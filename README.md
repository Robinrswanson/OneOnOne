## Usage

1. **Get Started**:
   - Click "Get Started" and register an account (any email format is acceptable).
   
2. **Manage Contacts**:
   - Go to the contacts page and send a contact request to another user via their username (if no other users exist, create another account).
   - Wait for the other user to accept the friend request via the contacts page.

3. **Create and Manage Calendars**:
   - Navigate to the calendars page.
   - Create a calendar by adding a name and an optional description, then click "Create Calendar".
   - Open the newly created calendar from the list below.
   - Create timeslots by dragging on the calendar and optionally adding a comment for the timeslot.
   - Edit the timeslot to add preference, exact duration, and modify the start time or comment as desired.

4. **Invite Contacts and Collect Preferences**:
   - Add desired contacts to the calendar through the dropdown menu.
   - Wait for other users to add their preferences for each timeslot.
   - If you are an attendee, open the calendar and add a preference to each timeslot, then click "Vote". This must be done for all timeslots.

5. **Suggest and Finalize Calendar**:
   - When all users have submitted their preferences, click "Suggest Calendar" to get a recommended calendar.
   - If there are no conflicts, finalize the desired calendar. Note that the total preference score indicates everyone's availabilityâ€”the higher the score, the more preferred the calendar is for everyone.
   - Once finalized, either email or notify everyone via website notifications about the finalized date.
   
6. **View Finalized Calendar**:
   - To view the finalized calendar again, go to the calendars tab and click on the calendar.
